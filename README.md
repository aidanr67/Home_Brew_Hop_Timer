# Home_Brew_Hop_Timer
Multiple instance, versatile hop timer

This is just a boil timer. A very versatile boil timer. Written in PyQt it requires Python, Qt4 and Pyaudio.

Particular strengths: You can create as many timers as you want (Handy for IPAs, or maybe even partial mash with steeping grains).
Timers can be added after the main timer has been started so adjustments can be made mid boil.
Can import hop additions from BrewTarget and set up timers automatically.

ToDo: Allow timer configurations to be saved. Integrate better with BrewTarget.
